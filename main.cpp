    Build/Run often with this task to make sure you're not breaking the code with each step.
    I recommend committing after you get each step working so you can revert to a working version easily if needed.
 
 0) in the blank space below, declare/define an empty struct named 'A' on a single Line. 
     on the lines below it, write a struct named 'HeapA' that correctly shows how to own an instance of 'A' 
         on the heap without leaking, without using smart pointers.

struct A {};
struct HeapA
{
    A* pointerToA = nullptr;

    HeapA( A* aPtr )
    { 
        pointerToA = aPtr;
    }

    ~HeapA()
    {
        delete pointerToA;
    }

 /*
 1) Edit your 3 structs so that they own a heap-allocated primitive type without using smart pointers  
         IntType should own a heap-allocated int, for example.
 
 2) give it a constructor that takes the appropriate primitive
    this argument will initialize the owned primitive's value.
         i.e. if you're owning an int on the heap, your ctor argument will initialize that heap-allocated int's value.
 
 3) modify those add/subtract/divide/multiply member functions from chapter 2 on it
         a) make them modify the owned numeric type
         b) set them up so they can be chained together.
             i.e.
             DoubleType dt(3.5);
             dt.add(3.0).multiply(-2.5).divide(7.2); //an example of chaining
 
 4) write add/subtract/divide/multiply member functions for each type that take your 3 UDTs
        These are in addition to your member functions that take primitives
        for example, IntType::divide(const DoubleType& dt);
        These functions should return the result of calling the function that takes the primitive.
     
 
 5) print out the results with some creative couts 
    i.e.
         FloatType ft(0.1f);
         IntType it(3);
         std::cout << "adding 3 and subtracting 'it' from 'ft' results in the following value: " << *ft.add(2.f).subtract( it ).value << std::endl;  //note the dereference of the `value` member of `ft`
 
 6) Don't let your heap-allocated owned type leak!
