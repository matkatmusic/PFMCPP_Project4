 Returning Values tasks 

 Create a branch named Part1

 Purpose:  This project will take you through the process of writing a class that wraps a numeric type, beginning with writing simple member functions and ending with a fully templated class with lots of functionality. 
 
 1) write 3 UDTs named FloatType, DoubleType, IntType.
 
 2) give each UDT the following member functions:
        add( lhs, rhs );
        subtract( lhs, rhs );
        multiply( lhs, rhs );
        divide( lhs, rhs );
 3) implement the appropriate action in the member function. 
         a) Be aware that floating point division by 0 is legal, but integer division by 0 will crash your program.  
         b) Handle this possible input when you write your divide() functions.
         c) you should warn the user if they're doing floating-point-division-by-zero but not prevent the division from happening
         d) you should warn AND prevent the division from happening if it is an integer-division-by-zero.
 
 4) make them return the correct primitive type. e.g. if you're implementing the FloatType::add function, your implementation would start like this:
        float FloatType::add( float lhs, float rhs )
 
 5) declare a few instances of each class in main() and call the member functions with the appropriate arguments.
        FloatType ft;
        auto result = ft.add(3.2f, 23.f );
 
 6) print out those results using std::cout:
        std::cout "result of ft.add(): " << result << std::endl;
 
 7) After you finish defining each type/function, click the [run] button.  Clear up any errors or warnings as best you can.
